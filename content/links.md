Over the years, while exploring on the internet, I come across pages/sites that really captivate me and capture my curiosity. I wish to keep a list of all these places for future reference and for the world to see and explore: 

* [How to Build a Biotech](https://www.celinehh.com/biotech)
&nbsp;

* [Cool Waterloo dev person](https://thume.ca/)
&nbsp;

* [Lots of deep dives into interesting topics](https://danwang.co/)
&nbsp;

* [A cool compendium of goodies on the topic of tools for thought](https://jameshk.com/)
&nbsp;

* [Startups holy grail resources](https://danromero.org/canon.html)
&nbsp;

<!-- * [Cool person with cool suggestions] (s) -->
