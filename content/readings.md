#### List of all books that I have read and would recommend 

* __Skin in the Game__ by Taleb
* __Meditations__ by Aurelius
* __David and Goliath__ by Gladwell (with the note that this is probably most effective to youngins' out there who feel like they are outliers (another malcolm gladwell book that is a decent read) - this book came to me at a time when I felt this and it gave me the permission to dream)
    - NB: The writer wants the reader to know that the writer felt like a badass when they used nested brackets
