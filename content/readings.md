&nbsp;



#### List of all books that I have read and would recommend 

* __Skin in the Game__ by Taleb
* __Meditations__ by Aurelius
* __David and Goliath__ by Gladwell (with the note that this is probably most effective to youngins' out there who feel like they are outliers (another malcolm gladwell book that is a decent read) - this book came to me at a time when I felt this and it gave me the permission to dream)
    - NB: The writer wants the reader to know that the writer felt like a badass when they used nested brackets
* __Bhagvat Gita__
* __Shoe Dog__ by Knight
* __Coming Storm__ by Lewis
* __Ender's Game__ by Card
* __Deep Work__ by Newport
* __So Good They Can't Ignore You__ by Newport
* __Zero to One__ by Thiel
* __Ego is the Enemy__ by Holiday
* __Lean Startup__ by Ries
* __Founders at Work__ by Livingston
* All Enid Blyton books (I used to be obsessed with them as a kid)
* __Great Gatsby__ by Fitzgerald (it was assigned reading in english in high school but had a lasting impact on me - thanks Mr. Chiba :p)

#### Interesting non-book media(blogs, podcasts, poems, interpretive dances etc.) that I really enjoy 

* [How to get Rich without getting lucky](https://nav.al/rich): Click-baity title I know. However, it is personally one of the most impactful piece of media I have ever consumed. This piece single-handedly changed the way I thought about certain paradigms completely. Also, all of Naval's podcasts are gold and things that I look forward to. 

* [Request for startups from YC](https://www.ycombinator.com/rfs/): In my opinion, this is a pretty solid list of some of the hardest problems that exist out there in the world. We (the world) need smart people to go work on meaningful problems and attack them head-on. That being said, if you are working on any of these, esp. Future of Work, AI, Improving Memory or VR/AR, let's talk :)
