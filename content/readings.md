#### Interesting non-book media(blogs, podcasts, poems, interpretive dances etc.) that I really enjoy 

* [How to get Rich without getting lucky](https://nav.al/rich): Click-baity title I know. However, it is personally one of the most impactful piece of media I have ever consumed. This piece single-handedly changed the way I thought about certain paradigms completely. Even if you don't fully agree with his stance on all things (I don't), I think there is something to take away for everybody here. 

* [Request for startups from YC](https://www.ycombinator.com/rfs/): In my opinion, this is a pretty solid list of some of the hardest problems that exist out there in the world. We (the world) need smart people to go work on meaningful problems and attack them head-on. That being said, if you are working on any of these, esp. Future of Work, AI, Improving Memory or VR/AR, let's talk :)

* [The Tail End](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/12/the-tail-end.html): Most of Tim Urban's articles are bangers and I try to read most as they come up but this one changed my outlook on life the most. When I think of the phrase 'reality check', this article comes to mind. 

* [Are You My Friend?](https://moretothat.com/are-you-my-friend/): Again, another person whose work I respect and appreciate so so much! Like Tim, Lawrence has a way to distill seemingly complicated life topics into digestible comics that are both entertaining to read and super profound at the same time. This article came at a time when I was trying to wrap my head around adult friendships. While friendships (and more generally relationships) are still a WIP, I feel much more grounded on my knowledge about them.
