As many wise men and women have said, compounding results are very real and this advice could not be more relevant to anything more than habits.
I hope to use this as a space to track all habits that I have successfully integrated into my lifestyle. In this case, success is defined as persisting the habit for > 21 days consecutively. 

* Making my bed right upon waking up 
* Doing pushups upon first step out of bed
* 5 minute Journal 
* 1 LC question a day
