Habits are really powerful tools that when utilized properly, have exponential returns. When it comes to this topic, something that I try to keep at the back of my mind is just how much could be accomplished in a year  if everyday, I choose to be 1% better than I was yesterday. This, of course, applies to the contrary as well:



​	<strong>0.99<sup>365</sup> = 0.03	</strong>

​	<strong>1<sup>365</sup> = 1</strong>

​	<strong>1.01<sup>365</sup> = 37.8</strong>





I hope to use this as a space to outline all habits that I have successfully integrated into my lifestyle that have had a net positive effect in my life. 

* Making my bed right upon waking up 

* Doing pushups upon first step out of bed

* 5 minute Journal 

* 1 LC question a day
