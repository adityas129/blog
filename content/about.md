 Hi there - I am Adi! I am currently a 3rd year Computer Engineering student at the Universiy of Waterloo with a special affinity to Deep Learning, Data Science and Engineering. Four years ago, I chose to study Engineering to learn the skills I needed to make products that impact lives of many people. A lot has changed since then; my reason for doing what I do though, has not. I aspire to leverage the skills that I have to develop projects that are exciting, ambitious, vertical, and impactful. 


&nbsp;

Besides working on projects, I thoroughly enjoy playing sports (I'm game for just about everything save for maybe bull-riding), reading(check out my reading list), riffing with friends about crazy ideas,tinkering with hardware, watching comedy and pretending to play the tabla.
