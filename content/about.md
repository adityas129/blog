Howdy - nice to see you here. I'm glad you stopped by!

I'm currently building and exploring ideas and products in ML, interfaces, financial infrastructure, and consumer AI. I am extremely excited about building important things that make the world better for everybody. Currently, that most likely takes the form of starting a company for me.

Previously I:

- Worked at Affirm, helping move frankly absurd amounts of money from one place to another on the Disbursements team
- Studied Computer Engineering at UWaterloo
    - Fun things I did during my time there included: starting and growing Socratica, going to many (and sometimes winning) hackathons, building self-driving (Watonomous) + solar car (Midnight Sun) software, trading + data science competitions, and eating a lot of Lazeez + Shinwa. 
- Worked as employee #1 and led all things Engineering at Pareto, building and managing a team of 6
- Built software + hardware across the stack (frontend, backend, data, infra, ml) at five different companies and research labs (Shaw, Citco, IBM, Plastic Havas, Tophatter)
- Developed drugs to prevent heart attacks at the University of Alberta at 15
- Worked on many many many projects spanning ML, Hardware (RISCV/Processor Design), and Software
- Got stuck at an airport in Germany for three days after losing my passport ([click here](https://www.asharma.me/posts/random) to read more random side-quests I've done)

For fun, I enjoy reading, sports (affinity twds runnings + racquet sports), playing the tabla, playing with LLMs, and traveling. 

I love hearing from people. Many of my friends, collaborators and co-conspirators in projects/companies have come from the internet. So pls, don't hesitate to reach out if you think we would vibe. The [contact tab](https://www.asharma.me/contact/) is just a few short internet steps away
