Why hello there - I’m Adi! I am currently exploring interfaces, financial infrastructure, AGI, consumer social, and mechanistic interpretability. 

&nbsp;

Previously, I worked at Affirm for two years - helping move frankly absurd amounts of money from one place to another. I went to school to study computer engineering at UWaterloo and learnt how to move bits and bytes to do things there. In the past, I’ve started (and failed at building) my own company, worked as a founding engineer at a super early-staged startup where I got the chance to build, grow and manage a team,  worked in software (frontend, backend, data, infra, ml) at a bunch of different places (5 fulltime internships to be exact) and got stuck at an airport in Germany for three days after losing my passport. 

I am intensely curious about the world around me and trying to understand how to make it better for everybody. I care to be an individual who builds important things even at the face of sweeping adversity with a resolve.

&nbsp;

For fun, I enjoy walking with people and learning about different life stories, playing and sometimes watching badminton and basketball, and trying to get better at chess.
