I'm building and exploring in interfaces, financial infrastructure, AGI and consumer social. I owe much of my fun to my friends and UWaterloo. I am extremely excited about building important things that make the world better for everybody.

Previously I:

- Worked at Affirm, helping move frankly absurd amounts of money from one place to another on the Disbursements team
- Studied Computer Engineering at UWaterloo
    - Fun things I did during my time there included: starting and growing Socratica, going to many (and sometimes winning) hackathons, building self-driving (Watonomous) + solar car (Midnight Sun) software, trading + data science competitions, and eating a lot of Lazeez + Shinwa. 
- Worked as employee #1 and led all things Engineering at Pareto, building and managing a team of 6
- Built software across the stack (frontend, backend, data, infra, ml) at five different companies and labs
- Started multiple companies (failed once, somewhat worked out another time)
- Developed drugs for heart attacks 
- Worked on many many many projects spanning ML, Hardware (RISCV/Processor Design), and Software
- Got stuck at an airport in Germany for three days after losing my passport (click here for more random things I've done)

For fun, I enjoy reading, sports (affinity twds runnings + racquet sports), playing with LLMs, and traveling.
