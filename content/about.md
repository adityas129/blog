 Hi there - I am Adi! I am currently a Computer Engineering student at the Universiy of Waterloo with a special affinity to Deep Learning, Data Science and Engineering. Three years ago, I chose to study Engineering to learn the skills I need to make products that impact lives of many people. A lot has changed since then; my reason for doing what I do though, has not. I aspire to leverage the skills that I have to develop projects that are exciting, ambitious, vertical, and impactful. 



Besides working on projects, I thoroughly enjoy playing sports (I'm game for just about everything save for maybe bull-riding), reading(check out my reading list), riffing with friends about crazy ideas,tinkering with hardware and pretending to play the tabla. 


Want to get in touch? Head over to the contacts tab to figure out how to do so!
