Writing is hard. But oh so valuable. 
I have so much respect for people who consistently write and find the time to reflect. It's such a hard endavour. Everytime I sit down to try to write, I always get distracted. There is literally an endless list of things to always do. I think though most of my time goes to doing the following things: 

1) Work things
2) Relationship things
3) Sustenance 
4) Working out 
5) Scheming what's next 
6) Procastinating the top 5
7) Random adult shit noone told me I had to do 


All these things keep on calling me and seeking my attention, making it hard at any given point to really focus you know. But hey, it do be what it be. Anything worth doing is really hard and a constant battle.
