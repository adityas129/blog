How does one win at life?

Cheeky title. It's a bit of a loaded question and one that changes over time. Currently, my answer to this is: 


1) Work out every day
2) Eat healthy
3) Get good sleep
4) Inculcate gratefulness
7) Be disciplined
8) Be persistent
9) Work hard and follow through 
10) Take risks
11) Surround yourself with good people who give a damn
