How does one win at life? 

Cheeky title. It's a bit of a loaded question and one that changes over time. Currently, my answer to this is: 


1. Work out every day
2. Eat healthy
3. Get good sleep
4. Inculcate gratefulness
5. Be disciplined about my work/craft of choice
6. Be persistent and unrelenting in my pursuit of my goals
7. Work hard and follow through (both equally important)
8. Take risks
9. Surround myself with really really good people who care and be the best friend/coworker/partner I can be. Show up the best way I can in those relationships.
10. Be a force for good in the world.
11. Lead my life with integrity, purpose, resolve and passion.
