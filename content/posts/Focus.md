# Focus


As my projects demand me to become more technical and go into heads down build mode, I find that there is a paradigm shift that happens within me when I become more like this. I enter into a "meditative like" state where I block everything out and just focus on the dev work/task ahead. Here are a few things that I do in particular to help me out with this: 

* Workout in the morning
* Go to a quiet place outside of my house if I can
* Keep water right by me 
* Have a clear schedule 
* Pomodoro sessions
* Self-Control mode on 
* Meditate/visualize for 2 mins before starting work and allow myself to believe
