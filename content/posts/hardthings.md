Waterloo was a crazy time in my life. So much happened. I am yet to reflect on it because I feel like any amount of words do injustice to the richness of experiences I had to fortune to live through at Waterloo. Yet I write do. Why you ask? I think I am now starting to realize that it's not impossible to concieve of a reality where memories fade into the abyss and become distant with the passage of time. It's a morbid thought but one grounded in reality. I desperately would like to grasp onto something to hold onto; to pay homage to this journey called life and the gifts called experiences. It kind of feels like buying life insurance. Don't think that will happen but in the off-chance that calamity strikes, I am prepared. So without further ado, here's my reflections. 

Going to school at Waterloo was a masterstroke of luck. I don't know how I got so incredibly lucky. I liked to think that in high school, I was equal amounts bold as hardworking. Equal amounts driven as I was ambitious. Even still, there are likely countless other people like me who also possess these characteristics. I somehow stumbled my way to win one of the biggest scholarships in Canada. There was a very sheer before and after for me.
