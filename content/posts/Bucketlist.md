Inspired by [Chip Huyen's list](https://huyenchip.com/list-100/), I wanted to create a list of things that I'd love to someday do before I die. I'm not sure if I can fit all of this in one life - but I'll try my best! Some of these are whimsical, some are more pragmatic. At any one point, you can find me trying to chase one of these. The hope is also to focus on 1 or 2 things at max at any given point. Doing more will lead to stress/unhappiness.  

1. Start a mission-oriented company (sector unknown but most likely in ML/devtool/creativity/fintech) 
2. Scale above company to great heights (I'm not sure how/what this means yet; need to find a good north star metric)
3. Find ways to fund education/provide good internet + devices in developing countries at a massive scale
4. Drive a superfast car on a racetrack (my middle school self was obsessed with cars)
5. Go skydiving
6. Partcipate in a play as an actor 
7. Give a speech in front of >1000 people
8. Fall in love
9. Learn how to do a backflip 
10. Go to La Tomatina festival 
11. Work on AGI Research 
12. Get a six-pack 
13. Run a marathon 
14. Pay for my parents' mortgage 
15. Learn how to ride a unicycle
16. Watch India vs Pakistan cricket match live (preferably at Wankhede)
17. Go to space 
18. Learn Spanish to a level of fluency
19. Take a dip in freezing water (Wim Hoff inspired)
20. Help make Earth sustainable 
21. Host a massive gathering of my favourite people (that I personally know) on Earth in Banff
22. Go for an impromptu weekend exploration to a different city 
23. Eat momos in Delhi without water
24. Try the Hot Ones Challenge (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Ones)
25. Camp alone in a national park/island for 5 days 
26. Visit great wall of China 
27. Take part in the biggest Water balloon fight in the world 
28. Treat family to a vacation
29. Visit South Africa 
30. Visit Congo 
31. Visit Senegal
32. Visit Peru
33. Buy everybody in a grocery store grocery
34. Solve telepathy (make language obselete)
35. Develop meaningful relationships with friends 
36. Play a sport for 24 hrs 
37. Do Standup
38. Become good at Tennis and Table-tennis
39. Memorize 1000 digits of Pi (was once at 270 - currently at probably around 140-150)
40. Keep adding to this list
