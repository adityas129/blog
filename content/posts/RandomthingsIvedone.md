Here's a list of random things I've done in no particular order:

- Became top 15 in mental arithmetics in World Maths Day (https://www.3plearning.com/world-maths-day/)
- Went from 670 to 1400 in 3 months in Blitz Chess in three days bc I got bored 
- Ran a marathon after running for like a year
- Slept at various airport multiple times to save money as a student. I have the art of sleeping in these situations down to a science. 
    - Not as a student but sleeping pods in CDMX has been my most enjoyable airport snooze experience. 
- Not eaten food for 36 hours.
