Here's a list of random side-quests I've embarked on in no particular order:

- Went from 670 to 1400 in 3 months in Blitz Chess in three days bc I got bored (used to play chess before but then stopped playing for a while)
- Ran a marathon after running for like a year
- Slept at various airport multiple times to save money as a student. I have the art of sleeping in these situations down to a science. 
    - Not as a student but sleeping pods in CDMX has been my most enjoyable airport snooze experience. 
- Not eaten food for 36 hours. 
- Memorized 500 digits of pi in a week to win a bet/contest in high school. (I have since forgotten the last 400 but I can't seem to erase the first 100)
- Broke my phone and got completely lost in Paris while solo-travelling (second day on the continent). I did not speak the language and broke it around 6 pm. I had also dropped my stuff in my hostel (whose name/location etc. I did not remember before leaving for the day)
- Became top 15 in the world in mental arithmetics in World Maths Day (https://www.3plearning.com/world-maths-day/) when I was 12
- Learnt Abacus 
- At some point in my life played the harmonium, piano, tabla (probably what I am most proficient in at this point), drums
- Crammed an entire course (and passed in uni) in 1.5 days. (I dont recommend this for things you actually want to learn but this was a required course for my program I had zero interest in)
- Ate an entire pizza by myself in one sitting on a dare. 
- Tried a four million scoville hot sauce in a hot sauce shop in Westfield Mall in SF (RIP)
- 24 hr fasts
