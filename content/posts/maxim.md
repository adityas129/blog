Seldom, certain hard earned aphorisms that reveal how the world really works surface in my day to day life that I want to store for record-keeping purposes. The reason being; while these learnings are quite localized, they seem to offer a lens into our ever-so-complicated world. Yes, in another world, I would just use Twitter/X ... I have an intuitive resistance to use Twitter as such. Call it contrarian, not subverting to the status quo, a small show of resistance againstherd-seeking mentality or what have you. This may change - I have though learnt to listen to my gut more than I did before. 

 

- The more I think about life and how decisions get made within companies, organizations or as a matter of fact any entity (entity hereby defined as any collectiion of one or more atomic units that act on their own accord), the more Ifind myself thinking that the real meat of where the confusion/unknown is tends to be a tradeoff between short term vs long term. Therefore, crystal clear clarity on timelines when embarking on an idea, vision or a project is half the battle and will make design decisions easier. 

- Clarity of thought implies an observer/follower is able to observe/follow a behaviour without much work. Analogous to the phrase of "XYZ person makes it look so easy" used perhaps more often than not in sports commentary, the easier it is to translate, the more viral it gets.
