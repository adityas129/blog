[The tweet that started it all](https://twitter.com/adityas129/status/1495465853776769035)

[Socratica](https://x.com/socraticainfo) has come quite a long way since the early days of me and Aman trying to break into classrooms in E7 on Sunday mornings in Winter 2022. It has since blossomed into one of the bigger orgs on campus, throwing incredible events that attract people from lands far away! Since the growth, some people naturally got curious about the birth of Socratica. So here is the tale of how it all started. 

I distinctly remember the exact moment I felt like something like Socratica should exist. It was during by 4B term, attending my very first MSCI422 class of the term, halfway through the term. The reason I was in that class in the first place was to fill my elective requirements and this course was known to be as "bird" as it gets. In other words, super easy to cram. Anyhow, there I was, sitting in the second row, trying to follow the prof but simply having absolutely no clue what she was talking about. Perhaps because I was three weeks behind on lectures LOL. This was peak interview season for fulltime recruiting so that, along with FYDP, was taking up all my energy and time at that point. At that point, in that class, at that very moment, I suddenly felt a pang of angst. Angst about the situation I was in. What am I doing here? Spending time in this class that I don't want to be in, frothing away from the prospects of my undergrad soon coming to a close. This soon brought upon a series of moments making me nostalgic of the good times I had in this beautiful place and grateful for the bad ones. For making me who I am. But amongst all the reflections, I couldn't push away this one feeling this was gnawing at me. This feeling of never being able to have fully fit in throughout my time at Waterloo. Never finding a tribe that I could bond over my creative obsessions on. Now timing is key here. I was in 3A when COVID changed the world. We went remote and it made for a drastically different experience than one that I originally signed up for. It wasn't until 4B that we were allowed back on campus. I felt like the most critical years of my uni experience were taken away from me. It was just 2B when I genuinely felt like I was starting to come to my own as someone in uni. Finding my footing in the vast campus. Prior to then, I was strictly operating on survival mode. Being in ECE, our 2nd year is one of the most challenging academically. What got me through those late study nights was the prospect of freeing up time to be able to explore creative pursuits once time frees up after surviving 2nd year. This was all the crazy projects I would try to get to. Whether it be hacking away on hardware projects, or working on fun software shenanigans. Or setting up the largest snowball fight in university history. The possibilities were endless. I wanted to do it all. With those around me. The change of policies brought upon by COVID definitely made me re-examine and pivot from my original plans of exploring. What followed for me, much like many people in the world, was a very different ride. While I did try my level best to make the most of the lockdown, it invariably lead to some amount of frustration. The thoughts of what could have been. If. Just if life was normal. Anyhow, there I was, ruminating over the things that could have been. And it was at that moment that I decided that while I personally wasn't able to meet like. 

Below is the very first memo [Aman](https://amanmathur.com/home) and I sent out to the first set of attendees of the inaugural Socratica session. A longer blog post on all things Socratica from my POV has been in works for quite some time but I promise I'll eventually finish it. In the meanwhile, here's the memo -  short, sweet but to the point:

## Welcome to Socratica!

Thank you again for your interest in Socratica - we are really excited that you are interested! Our intention with Socratica is to bring the best builders/entrepreneurs/creators together under one roof to inspire each other.

### Why we started Socratica

Time and time again throughout history, we have seen that magical things  can happen when you are surrounded by the right people under the right circumstances. [The Inklings](https://loc.ignatius.com/looking-for-the-king/who-were-the-inklings.htm) played a sizable role in the success of many of the worldâ€™s best writers  of the time. [Bell Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs) has been known for being the birthplace of some of the most innovative creations of the 20th century. Berkeley research labs like [Amp Labs and Rise Labs](https://www.businessinsider.com/uc-berkeley-labs-databricks-sifive-anyscale-riselab-amplab-2021-9) are contemporary examples of how focussed collaboration can lead to outsized impact under the right circumstances.
 
We at Socratica are excited to gather the creative spirits of Waterloo to create some of the same magic and hope that this can be a birthing place for many great things. We really hope that you join us in making Socratica a truly special place. 

Warmly, \
Adi and Aman
