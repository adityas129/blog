[The tweet that started it all](https://twitter.com/adityas129/status/1495465853776769035). 

Below is the very first memo [Aman](https://amanmathur.com/home) and I sent out to the first set of attendees of the inaugural Socratica session. Very short, sweet but to the point:

## Welcome to Socratica!

Thank you again for your interest in Socratica - we are really excited that you are interested! Our intention with Socratica is to bring the best builders/entrepreneurs/creators together under one roof to inspire each other.

### Why we started Socratica

Time and time again throughout history, we have seen that magical things  can happen when you are surrounded by the right people under the right circumstances. [The Inklings](https://loc.ignatius.com/looking-for-the-king/who-were-the-inklings.htm) played a sizable role in the success of many of the worldâ€™s best writers  of the time. [Bell Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs) has been known for being the birthplace of some of the most innovative creations of the 20th century. Berkeley research labs like [Amp Labs and Rise Labs](https://www.businessinsider.com/uc-berkeley-labs-databricks-sifive-anyscale-riselab-amplab-2021-9) are contemporary examples of how focussed collaboration can lead to outsized impact under the right circumstances.
 
We at Socratica are excited to gather the creative spirits of Waterloo to create some of the same magic and hope that this can be a birthing place for many great things. We really hope that you join us in making Socratica a truly special place. 

Warmly, 
Adi and Aman
