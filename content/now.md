I felt like I needed to start a changelog for my project to keep me accountable and keep me on track. I'm not sure how the extent/how I'll use it but I'm going to start it.
Hope is to be more open as I build Connect Dot -> a consumer facing product that I'm building!

Synced up with V and got aligned on the direction of the project. Going to try to bang out OAuth and API calls for backend from scratch. Still hoping to ship by this week.
