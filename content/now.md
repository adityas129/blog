What's up my life right now?

#### Work 
* T'has been a very relaxing holidays break thus far. I was able to build upon some really good habits and get into some good routines. Hoping to take that and continue that in 2020 to start the decade right! 201x has been fantastic but I am soo ready for 202x!!!!
* Taking this coop off(Winter 2020) to learn how to make products and ship them and bring them to life 

#### Life Experiences
* Played a bunch of board games with fam and kicked their butt while doing it. Scrabble is sooo much fun!!! This was much needed as I hadn't been home for a year and haven't had time to connect with the fam for a long time. Felt very good to connect after a long time  
* There is a lot of things to learn from Monopoly. 
* Maintaining relationships are so important. At the end of the day, that's what it's all about right?
