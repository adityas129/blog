What's up my life right now?

#### Work

    ** Harvard is really cool in terms of the building



#### Life Experiences
* August 10th, '19 : Went out with Matt and Tony to Taste of Danforth!! Ate a few spinach pies, smashed some plates and yelled OPA and had a whole bunch of fun! We then went to Trinity Bellwoods to play Ulti + Soccer - in an attempt to bicycle kick, almost had a concussion lol. Finally capped the night off by going to a comedy show headlined by Keith Pedro - also tons of fun! All in all, a great day. 
* Sept 15th, '19: Stayed up for 40 hrs!!!!
