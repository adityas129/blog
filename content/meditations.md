This is a space where I just note down random shit that comes to me: 

* Freedom in this day and age is directly proportional to courage 
* Essentialism is the key to progress 
* Discipline is freedom - Jocko Willink (I think that's how it's spelled?)
* Hooks/Systems are the best way to cultivate productive behaviour 
* AI safety is insanely important 
* Knowledge needs to become decentralized
