This is a space where I just note down random ideas and thoughts that come to me: 


* Habits are really powerful tools that when utilized properly, have exponential returns. When it comes to this topic, something that I try to keep at the back of my mind is just how much could be accomplished in a year if everyday, I choose to be 1% better than I was yesterday.
* Freedom in this day and age is directly proportional to courage 
* Essentialism is the key to progress 
* Discipline is freedom - Jocko Willink (I think that's how it's spelled?)
* Hooks/Systems are the best way to cultivate productive behaviour 
* AI safety is insanely important 
* Knowledge needs to become decentralized 
* I don't need to wait to get to an X position to do meaningful work. It can start right here and right now
* At the end of the day, the only thing under my control associated to me is hustle. While true meritocracy may not exist, I am currently in an extremely priveledged place to attain to conversion of hardwork to success in my chosen field
* Every action, however huge or small is a step towards the future self
* It is a futile exercise to compare progress of oneself to other people - everybody has a different background and each individual has their strengths and weaknesses
* Mimetic desire is a powerful force that can be harnessed to do great things but also the contrary 
* Be known to do the right thing, always and do it well
* Careers are long
* Always be learning and curiosity driven
* Contrary to defauult state of my mind, it's good to feel things no matter how strong the urge to intellectualize it
* Thought-looping is a trap. ACTION PRODUCES INFORMATION WHICH PRODUCES DIRECTION
* Along a similar vein, momentum is powerful; when you catch a whiff of momentum, double down fast
