Changelog for the entreprenurial journey -> currently on the quest to build a consumer facing product that I'm building!

### 1/12/2025 

Synced up with V and got aligned on the direction of the project. Going to try to bang out OAuth and API calls for backend from scratch. Still hoping to ship by this week. Feels good to be moving and motivated again. Caught up with some founder friends which is fun; dropped by Playspace as well.
