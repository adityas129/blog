Changelog for the entreprenurial journey -> currently on the quest to build a consumer facing AI product 

### 1/14/2025 

Clarified priorities with V! I think we will hit our deadline. Finished integrating the backend with Frontend for most of the features. There's a few calls that need to be tied up and some optimizations to be done. But we are getting there. Had a good sync with V and got aligned on the direction of the project and what we can do to make things faster. Still on track to ship by the 16th. 

Lessons learned: 
1. When you are working on a project, it's always good to have a clear direction and a plan. We were laizze-fairing a little bit and had multiple balls in flight which made coordination difficult. Clarifying things made it difficult. 
2. Really think about the unique insight/value prop you are providing and let that drive the product. 
3. Make sure to peer out to see bird's eye view every once in a while to ensure you are focussing on the right thing.

Struggles: 
1. How to fuel myself (nutrition, sleep, exercise) for maxium productivity. I had been cutting weight for a bit but I realized that I was not eating enough to sustain my energy levels. I've been trying to eat more and I've been trying to get more sleep. 


### 1/13/2025 

Doing consistent syncs help - who would've thought. I REALLY HATE REMOTE WORK though - V still in Toronto and I'm in SF and it dampens productivity. Anyhow, backend stuff is finally working; chrome extension fully worked. Tomorrow, hoping to put a bow on UI/UX, add analytics and do some testing. We are getting there. I'm hoping we are feature complete by tomorrow. We are setting an internal deadline to be feature/code complete by the 16th.

Lessons learned: 
1. Get out of the house ASAP. 



### 1/12/2025 

Synced up with V and got aligned on the direction of the project. Got started on  OAuth and API calls for backend today (backend finally working after having db issues)- going to try to bang out all the backend stuff by eod tmrw. Still hoping to ship by this week. Feels good to be moving and motivated again. Caught up with some founder friends which is fun; dropped by Playspace as well.
