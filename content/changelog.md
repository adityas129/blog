Changelog for the entreprenurial journey -> currently on the quest to build a consumer facing product that I'm building!

### 1/12/2025 

Synced up with V and got aligned on the direction of the project. Got started on  OAuth and API calls for backend today (backend finally working after having db issues)- going to try to bang out all the backend stuff by eod tmrw. Still hoping to ship by this week. Feels good to be moving and motivated again. Caught up with some founder friends which is fun; dropped by Playspace as well.
