    <p> </p>
<p>This is a non-exhaustive (read VERY non-exhaustive because many don&rsquo;t end up getting done because I lost interest or lacked time/resources and some in stealth mode ) list of projects I&rsquo;ve worked on over time. Some are in production, many didn&rsquo;t survive but were valuable learning experiences. Feel free to explore!
 </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://my-kore.com/">Kore</a>: A personal analytics platform that connects your LLM interactions and browsing history to uncover patterns about yourself. Uses data analysis to surface unconscious behaviors and interests, helping you better understand your digital habits while maintaining privacy. Discovered some surprising things about myself in the process. Also has a matching component where we do embeddings to match you to someone who has very similar interests!
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://socratica.info/">Socratica</a>: Started and helped scale community of makers, builders, and creators that hosts weekly co-working sessions. Initially worked on establishing vision, recruiting, building the community to logistics (yay for food runs in -40; all for the love of making). Socratica has since (after my time) expanded to 40 cities (and 6 continents) across the world and counting, creating spaces where people collaborate on projects they care about with people rallying to support them! All thanks to the wonderful people who are involved with flourishing the <a href="https://www.socratica.info/people">org</a>. The feeling of having someone recognize me and telling me Socratica changed their life is a true blessing (although I do think credit to me is unfair - it&rsquo;s truly a labor of love from all the lovely people involved).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/adityas129/pipelined-processor">Pipelined Processor</a>: Built a complete pipelined processor in Verilog from scratch with data hazard detection, forwarding mechanisms, and control hazard handling. Went deep on computer architecture principles and hardware description. Debugging hardware is a different beast entirely.
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/prism-fydp">PRISM</a>: A decentralized publishing platform giving writers ownership of their ideas without institutional overhead. Built on IPFS and cryptocurrency to connect authors directly with readers while preserving anonymity. Challenging the assumption that content platforms need centralized control. Navigating the tradeoffs between user experience and true decentralization made me appreciate both the promise and complexity of Web3.
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://sixfeet.chat/">Six Feet Away</a>: Built a platform for spontaneous online interactions by having an always open tab that you can &ldquo;drop-into&rdquo; anytime you&rsquo;d like to talk to people. Shows what friends are actually doing (gaming, working out, studying) to facilitate natural connection points online. Traditional social networks require too much effort to start conversations - we wanted to fix that and bring the barrier to entry for meaningful social interactions down.
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://ece2022profile.github.io/report.pdf">ECE 2022 Class Profile</a>: Collaborated on data collection, analysis, visualization and marketing for the Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering class profile. Transformed raw survey data into meaningful insights about the student experience, career pathways, and program outcomes. Working with anonymized data to tell authentic stories about real people is a challenging balance - and surprisingly addictive. Such a fun way to cap off my time at UWaterloo.
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://moshimoshi.chat/">moshimoshi</a>: An anonymous message board with topics that rotate every 24 hours. Designed to encourage meaningful conversations instead of superficial interactions. Trying to recreate those energizing in-person discussions where you walk away feeling more curious than before.
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Emotion]: A neural interface experiment using the <a href="https://www.emotiv.com/epoc/">Emotiv EEG Headset</a> for emotion detection. Hit hardware limitations (as Thomas Reardon aptly put it, EEG is like &ldquo;having a conversation in a stadium of 50,000 screaming fans&rdquo;), but gained valuable insights into Brain-Computer Interfaces. Still bullish on the technology&rsquo;s potential.
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://prufer.io/">Prufer</a>: A presentation platform built to do for PowerPoint what Notion did for Word. Created a more flexible framework for visual communication without the rigidity of traditional slideware. <a href="https://pitch.com/">Pitch</a> beat us to market, but the experience in product design was worth it.
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Fun lowlevel engineering]: For fun, in the past, I have built an tiny OS from scratch and a compiler from scratch. Programmed many FPGAs and built and fried many circuits. Built audio-systems and amplifiers and the like.
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/adityas129/298">Nearer</a>: A bicycle proximity detection system using ultrasonic sensors. Went through the full hardware lifecycle from schematic design to PCB layout to soldering and firmware. Learned that hardware is indeed hard, but incredibly satisfying when it works.
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://devpost.com/software/doway">LabelLearn</a>: A platform for consistent data labeling with real-time visualization of dataset distributions. Built the web application and infrastructure. Won our track and best overall hack at HackMIT 2019 among 200+ submissions. Turns out machine learning is only as good as your labels.
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://devpost.com/software/sundae">Sundae</a>: A journaling chatbot using NLP and sentiment analysis to provide emotional support. Developed the NLP components and recommendation engine. Won Best Domain at EngHack 2019. Fascinating to see how simple NLP techniques can create meaningful interactions.
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://devpost.com/software/messiah-ngp1x8">Messiah</a>: An oracle management interface giving developers reliable access to blockchain data. Contributed to contract development and frontend implementation. Learned that blockchain&rsquo;s biggest challenge isn&rsquo;t the chain itself, but connecting it reliably to the outside world.
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://devpost.com/software/myovision">MyoVision</a>: A workout assistant using the Myo armband and statistical analysis to improve exercise form and track activity. Developed the Myo API integration and analytics. Won Most Innovative Wolfram Alpha award. The project taught me how much untapped potential exists in wearable tech.
