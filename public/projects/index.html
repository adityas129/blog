<p>This is a non-exhaustive list of projects I have worked on and am proud of. I only started writing here what I work on recently so this is why there are a whole bunch missing (I&rsquo;d reckon this is about 20% of all the projects I have worked on). For listed projects here, some are shipped, others are not. Regardless, feel free to look around!
&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://sixfeet.chat/">Six Feet Away</a>: Worked on this with five other folks to encourage and foster spontaneous conversations. Facebook is great but the activation energy it takes to start a conversation from scratch is way too high. Also, besides the green circle indicating they are active, there is no more insight into what friends are <strong>ACTUALLY</strong> doing. With Six Feet Away, see what friends are doing, such as playing video games or working out, and join them.<br /></li>

<li><p><a href="https://moshimoshi.chat/">moshimoshi</a>: Anonymouse message board with a new topic every 24h. The hope is to encourage folks to engage in more meaningful and thought-provoking conversations. You know, the ones where you walk away feeling more invigorated, energized and curious than before. Trying to simulate that online
&nbsp;</p></li>

<li><p>Emotion: Built an emotion detector on top of the <a href="https://www.emotiv.com/epoc/">Emotiv EEG Headset</a>. To be honest, it wasn&rsquo;t as good as I hoped since there were hardware constraints. Also, Thomas Reardon (CTRL-Labs dude) describes EEG as trying to have a conversation while in a stadium of 50,000 people yelling. However, I&rsquo;m still super interested and bullish about Brain Computer Interfaces. If you know something I don&rsquo;t, do share!
&nbsp;</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://prufer.io/">Prufer</a>: Worked on trying to make Powerpoints and presentations suck less for a little while. The hope was to do what Notion did to Word for presentations. Unfortunately, didn&rsquo;t finish building the entire platform (found that <a href="https://pitch.com/">another company</a> was ahed when building this) but was a great learning experience regardless!</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://github.com/adityas129/298">Nearer</a>: Nearby Object Detector for Bicycles using Ultrasonic sensors. Had a fun time building this project as I learned about the entire lifecycle of building hardware from designing a schematic to designing PCBs to soldering and developing the software
&nbsp;</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://devpost.com/software/doway">LabelLearn</a>: This project aims to enable a labeller to be consistent with both their fellow labelers and their past self while seeing the live class distribution of the dataset. I mainly worked on the web application and infrastructure for the project. We ended up winning our track (category) price and the overall best hack out of 200+ hacks @ HackMIT 2019!
&nbsp;</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://devpost.com/software/sundae">Sundae</a>: A text based journaling chatbot that uses NLP and sentimental analysis to cheer you up. I worked on the NLP portion and the recommendation engine. We ended up winning the Best Domain price @ EngHack 2019!
&nbsp;</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://devpost.com/software/messiah-ngp1x8">Messiah</a>: Messiah is an oracle management interface that developers can interact with to get the most reliable data from blockchains. I contributed to contract development and the frontend.
&nbsp;</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://devpost.com/software/myovision">MyoVision</a>: A workout assister that uses Myo and statistics to improve your posture while also serving as a tracker of your activity. I worked on the interfacing with Myo API + analytics. We ended up winning Most Innovative Wolfram Alpha award!
