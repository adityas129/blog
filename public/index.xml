      <title>On being the dumbest person in the room</title>

      <description>Every now so often, I feel like I am in a room where I feel like the people I am interacting with are on a much higher level than me. The natural and the wrong reaction that I tend to exhibit is feign intelligence. This is dumb and helps nobody in the long term. The reason behind why I feign probably has ties with my System 1 (see Thinking Fast and Slow by Kahneman) kicking in.</description>

      <description>Note: This is a living document Inspired by Chip Huyen&amp;rsquo;s list, I wanted to create a list of things that I&amp;rsquo;d love to someday do before I die. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I can fit all of this in one life - but I&amp;rsquo;ll try my best! Some of these are whimsical, some are more pragmatic. At any one point, you can find me trying to chase one of these -&amp;gt; currently focussed on 1 and 2.</description>

      <description>As I spend my time pent up at home during quarantine, I came to learn that one of my chemistry teachers back in high school moved down the street from our place! That was very cool and sent me down a memory lane and a flashback of high school. This teacher in particular was somebody that I always had a great time learning from. In addition to teaching Chemistry in an awesome way, she was always open to talk about life in general and as teenagers learning to take baby-steps into adulthood, these riffing sessions were so interesting.</description>

      <title>What I want to be doing in X years</title>

      <description>Ahhh the age old question. The deviations of this, Where do you see yourself in x years also attempts to pry an answer akin to what this question does. It has always been weird to me. So for once and for all, I decided to write about my answer to this.
At this given time, the heuristics that I use to decide what I want to work on revolves around three main factors: curiosity/enjoyment, people I am working with, and positive impact on the world.</description>

      <title>Interact Application</title>

      <description>So recently, I applied to a program that I had heard great things about called Interact. The application itself was actually super fun to doand I found the questions to be very incisive and thought-provoking. This was one of the very few applications (maybe 2-3) in my entire life that I actually enjoyed finishing and even if I get in or not, I&amp;rsquo;m grateful I applied! I decided to make the answer to some of the questions public as I think they do a decent job of expressing who I am and things I care about.</description>

      <description>As my projects demand me to become more technical and go into heads down build mode, I find that there is a paradigm shift that happens within me to help me focus and be productive. I enter into a &amp;ldquo;meditative like&amp;rdquo; state where I block everything out and just focus on the dev work/task ahead. Here are a few things that I do in particular to help me out with this:</description>

      <title>Winter 2020</title>

      <description>Why I took Winter 2020 off? For the past three years, as a University of Waterloo student, I have gotten the opportunity to partake in four different co-ops/internships alternating between school terms. I have found these experiences to be so invaluable to my learnings as an engineering student and just as a human and I am so grateful for each one of them. However, because of this busy schedule of going back and forth between school and co-op, I found that I had very little time to explore some of the projects/passions/interests I wanted to.</description>

      <description>Hi there - I am Adi! I am currently a 3rd year Computer Engineering student at the Universiy of Waterloo with a special affinity to Deep Learning, Data Science and Engineering. Four years ago, I chose to study Engineering to learn the skills I needed to make products that impact lives of many people. A lot has changed since then; my reason for doing what I do though, has not. I aspire to leverage the skills that I have to develop projects that are exciting, ambitious, vertical, and impactful.</description>

      <description>Note: This is a living document Over the years, while exploring on the internet, I come across pages/sites that really captivate me and capture my curiosity. I wish to keep a list of all these places for future reference and for the world to see and explore:
Celine: How to Build a Biotech Tristan Hume: Cool Waterloo developer! Dan Wang: Lots of deep dives into interesting topics Paul Graham: for the uninitiated, dude who created YC and a really clear thinker</description>

      <description>This is a space where I just note down random ideas and thoughts that come to me:
Habits are really powerful tools that when utilized properly, have exponential returns. When it comes to this topic, something that I try to keep at the back of my mind is just how much could be accomplished in a year if everyday, I choose to be 1% better than I was yesterday. Freedom in this day and age is directly proportional to courage Essentialism is the key to progress Discipline is freedom - Jocko Willink (I think that&amp;rsquo;s how it&amp;rsquo;s spelled?</description>

      <description>This is a non-exhaustive list of projects I have worked on and am proud of. I only started writing here what I work on recently so this is why there are a whole bunch missing (I&amp;rsquo;d reckon this is about 20% of all the projects I have worked on). For listed projects here, some are shipped, others are not. Regardless, feel free to look around! Six Feet Away: Worked on this with five other folks to encourage and foster spontaneous conversations.</description>

      <description>Questions that I struggle with/ponder often about to this day
How do I cultivate crystal-clear thinking? Can human decision-making be automated? Is all of life just a story that each individual makes up/tell ourselves? In other words, is objectivity an illusion? What came first, the chicken or the egg? (lol) Can one be calm/happy while also chasing goals? It seems to me that to chase a big goal, one has to embrace the desire to be at the top.</description>

      <description>List of Books I&amp;rsquo;m currently reading Dune Courage to be Disliked Talking to Strangers Letters to a Young Contrarian List of all books that I have read and would recommend Skin in the Game by Taleb Meditations by Aurelius David and Goliath by Gladwell (with the note that this is probably most effective to youngins&amp;rsquo; out there who feel like they are outliers (another malcolm gladwell book that is a decent read) - this book came to me at a time when I felt this and it gave me the permission to dream) NB: The writer wants the reader to know that the writer felt like a badass when they used nested brackets Bhagvat Gita Shoe Dog by Knight Coming Storm by Lewis Ender&amp;rsquo;s Game by Card Deep Work by Newport So Good They Can&amp;rsquo;t Ignore You by Newport Zero to One by Thiel Ego is the Enemy by Holiday Lean Startup by Ries Founders at Work by Livingston All Enid Blyton books (I used to be obsessed with them as a kid) Great Gatsby by Fitzgerald (it was assigned reading in english in high school but had a lasting impact on me - thanks Mr.</description>
