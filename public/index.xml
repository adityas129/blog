      <description>As I spend my time pent up at home during quarantine, I came to learn that one of my chemistry teachers back in high school moved down the street from our place! That was very cool and sent me down a memory lane and a flashback of high school. This teacher in particular was somebody that I always had a great time learning from. In addition to teaching Chemistry in an awesome way, she was always open to talk about life in general and as teenagers learning to take baby-steps into adulthood, these riffing sessions were so interesting.</description>

      <description>Ahhh the age old question. The deviations of this, Where do you see yourself in x years also attempts to pry an answer akin to what this question does. It has always been weird to me. So for once and for all, I decided to write about my answer to this.
At this given time, the heuristics that I use to decide what I want to work on revolves around three main factors: curiosity/enjoyment, people I am working with, and positive impact on the world.</description>

      <description>So recently, I applied to a program that I had heard great things about called Interact. The application itself was actually super fun to doand I found the questions to be very incisive and thought-provoking. This was one of the very few applications (maybe 2-3) in my entire life that I actually enjoyed finishing and even if I get in or not, I&amp;rsquo;m grateful I applied! I decided to make the answer to some of the questions public as I think they do a decent job of expressing who I am and things I care about.</description>

      <description>As my projects demand me to become more technical and go into heads down build mode, I find that there is a paradigm shift that happens within me to help me focus and be productive. I enter into a &amp;ldquo;meditative like&amp;rdquo; state where I block everything out and just focus on the dev work/task ahead. Here are a few things that I do in particular to help me out with this:</description>

Why I took Winter 2020 off? -- Why I took Winter 2020 off? For the past three years, as a University of Waterloo student, I have gotten the opportunity to partake in four different co-ops/internships alternating between school terms. I have found these experiences to be so invaluable to my learnings as an engineering student and just as a human and I am so grateful for each one of them.</description>

      <description>Hi there - I am Adi! I am currently a Computer Engineering student at the Universiy of Waterloo with a special affinity to Deep Learning, Data Science and Engineering. Three years ago, I chose to study Engineering to learn the skills I need to make products that impact lives of many people. A lot has changed since then; my reason for doing what I do though, has not. I aspire to leverage the skills that I have to develop projects that are exciting, ambitious, vertical, and impactful.</description>

      <description>Note: This is a living document &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;
Over the years, while exploring on the internet, I come across pages/sites that really captivate me and capture my curiosity. I wish to keep a list of all these places for future reference and for the world to see and explore:
 Celine: How to Build a Biotech &amp;nbsp;
 Tristan Hume: Cool Waterloo developer! &amp;nbsp;
 Dan Wang: Lots of deep dives into interesting topics &amp;nbsp;</description>

      <description>This is a space where I just note down random ideas and thoughts that come to me:
 Habits are really powerful tools that when utilized properly, have exponential returns. When it comes to this topic, something that I try to keep at the back of my mind is just how much could be accomplished in a year if everyday, I choose to be 1% better than I was yesterday. Freedom in this day and age is directly proportional to courage Essentialism is the key to progress Discipline is freedom - Jocko Willink (I think that&amp;rsquo;s how it&amp;rsquo;s spelled?</description>

 Brain Hardware: In progress - learning more about BCI as I go at it :) &amp;nbsp;
 Nearer: Nearby Object Detector for Bicycles using Ultrasonic sensors. Had a fun time building this project as I learned about the entire lifecycle of building hardware from designing a schematic to designing PCBs to soldering and developing the software &amp;nbsp;
 LabelLearn: This project aims to enable a labeller to be consistent with both their fellow labelers and their past self while seeing the live class distribution of the dataset.</description>

      <description>Questions that I struggle with to this day
 Is a calm mind better or one with a bunch of crazy ideas? How should I best engineer my environment to optimize growth + development? What are my scales and what is the best way to practice my scales? How do I manage information intake? What aspects of my identity are worth preserving? How do I conquer the mind and it&amp;rsquo;s primal needs?</description>
