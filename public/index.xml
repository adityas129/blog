      <description>Focus As my projects demand me to become more technical and go into heads down build mode, I find that there is a paradigm shift that happens within me to help me focus and be productive. I enter into a &amp;ldquo;meditative like&amp;rdquo; state where I block everything out and just focus on the dev work/task ahead. Here are a few things that I do in particular to help me out with this:</description>

      <description>So recently, I applied to a program that I had heard great things about called Interact. I had heard really good things about it from various people that I admired and decided to apply. The application process was actually super fun and I found the questions to be very incisive and authentic. This was one of the few applications that I actually enjoyed finishing and even if I get in or not, I&amp;rsquo;m grateful I applied!</description>

Why I took Winter 2020 off? -- Why I took Winter 2020 off? For the past three years, as a University of Waterloo student, I have gotten the opportunity to partake in four different co-ops/internships alternating between school terms. I have found these experiences to be so invaluable to my learnings as an engineering student and just as a human and I am so grateful for each one of them.</description>

      <description>Hi there - I am Adi! I am currently a Computer Engineering student at the Universiy of Waterloo with a special affinity to Deep Learning, Data Science and Engineering. Three years ago, I chose to study Engineering to learn the skills I need to make products that impact lives of many people. A lot has changed since then; my reason for doing what I do though, has not. I aspire to leverage the skills that I have to develop projects that are exciting, ambitious, vertical, and impactful.</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s up my life right now?
Last Updated: Jan 28th 2020
Work  Currently working on two projects: building a tool to reinvent the way we present and a tool to boost productivity (I know what you are thinking, not another one of these - i swear this is different) Have not progressed much on the ML learning side of the things - hope to fix that soon  Life Experiences  real talk : GP seems kinda boring now that most of the people my age are not in town.</description>

      <description>Over the years, while exploring on the internet, I come across pages/sites that really captivate me and capture my curiosity. I wish to keep a list of all these places for future reference and for the world to see and explore:
 How to Build a Biotech &amp;nbsp;
 Cool Waterloo dev person &amp;nbsp;
 Lots of deep dives into interesting topics &amp;nbsp;

      <description>This is a space where I just note down random ideas and thoughts that come to me:
 Freedom in this day and age is directly proportional to courage Essentialism is the key to progress Discipline is freedom - Jocko Willink (I think that&amp;rsquo;s how it&amp;rsquo;s spelled?) Hooks/Systems are the best way to cultivate productive behaviour AI safety is insanely important Knowledge needs to become decentralized I don&amp;rsquo;t need to wait to get to an X position to do meaningful work.</description>

      <description>Questions that I struggle with to this day
 Is a calm mind better or one with a bunch of crazy ideas? How do I manage information intake? What aspects of my identity are worth preserving? How do I conquer the mind and it&amp;rsquo;s primal needs? How do I rapidly iterate my understanding of a very niche area and become a domain expert? How should I increase my rate of learning as a developer?</description>
