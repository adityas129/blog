      <description>Hi there - I am Adi! I am currently a Computer Engineering student at the Universiy of Waterloo with a special affinity to Deep Learning, Data Science and Engineering. Three years ago, I chose to study Engineering to learn the skills I need to make products that impact lives of many people. A lot has changed since then; my reason for doing what I do though, has not. I aspire to leverage the skills that I have to develop projects that are exciting, ambitious, vertical, and impactful.</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s up my life right now?
Work  T&amp;rsquo;has been a very relaxing holidays break thus far. I was able to build upon some really good habits and get into some good routines. Hoping to take that and continue that in 2020 to start the decade right! 201x has been fantastic but I am soo ready for 202x!!!! Taking this coop off(Winter 2020) to learn how to make products and ship them and bring them to life  Life Experiences  Played a bunch of board games with fam and kicked their butt while doing it.</description>

      <description>Habits are really powerful tools that when utilized properly, have exponential returns. When it comes to this topic, something that I try to keep at the back of my mind is just how much could be accomplished in a year if everyday, I choose to be 1% better than I was yesterday. This, of course, applies to the contrary as well:
​ 0.99365 = 1 
​ 1365 = 1</description>

      <description>This is a space where I just note down random shit that comes to me:
 Freedom in this day and age is directly proportional to courage Essentialism is the key to progress Discipline is freedom - Jocko Willink (I think that&amp;rsquo;s how it&amp;rsquo;s spelled?) Hooks/Systems are the best way to cultivate productive behaviour AI safety is insanely important Knowledge needs to become decentralized I don&amp;rsquo;t need to wait to get to an X position to do meaningful work.</description>

      <description>Is a calm mind better or one with a bunch of crazy ideas? How do I manage information intake? What aspects of my identity are worth preserving? How do I conquer the mind and it&amp;rsquo;s primal needs? How do I rapidly iterate my understanding of a very niche area and become a domain expert? How should I increase my rate of learning as a developer? Is specialization in technical skills worth it or is being a generalist more aligned for my goals?</description>
